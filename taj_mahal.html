                The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum in Agra, India, on the right bank of 
                the Yamuna River. It was built in 1632 by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (r. 1628–1658) to 
                contain the tomb of Mumtaz Mahal, his favourite wife, as well as Shah Jahan's own 
                mausoleum. The mausoleum is placed in formal gardens and is surrounded on three sides 
                by a crenellated wall. It is part of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex that also contains 
                a mosque and a guest house. <br>
                The mausoleum was substantially finished in 1643, but work on other aspects of the 
                building proceeded for another ten years. The Taj Mahal complex is thought to have been 
                finished in its entirety in 1653 at a cost of around 32 million pounds, which would be 
                around 70 billion pounds in 2020 (around $1 billion). 20,000 artisans worked on the 
                project, which was overseen by a board of architects chaired by Ustad Ahmad Lahauri, 
                the emperor's court architect. <br>
                In 1983, the Taj Mahal was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site for being "India's 
                jewel of Muslim art and one of the world's most universally admired masterpieces." 
                Many consider it to be the finest example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of 
                India's long history. The Taj Mahal receives over 6 million tourists each year and 
                was named one of the New 7 Wonders of the World (2000–2007) programme winners in 2007.

                The Taj Mahal is a popular tourist destination. In 2001, UNESCO recorded over 
                2 million visitors, which had climbed to around 7–8 million in 2014. There is a 
                two-tier pricing system in place, with Indian citizens paying a cheaper entrance 
                price and foreigners paying a higher fee. In 2018, the charge for Indian nationals 
                was 50 rupees, while the fee for foreign tourists was 1,100 rupees. The cooler months 
                of October, November, and February attract the majority of travellers. Polluting 
                vehicles are not permitted near the complex, so visitors must either walk or take an 
                electric bus. The Khawasspuras (northern courtyards) are currently undergoing restoration 
                in preparation for its reopening as a new visitor centre. <br>
                Taj Ganji or Mumtazabad, a little village to the south of the Taj, was built with 
                caravanserais, bazaars, and markets to suit the requirements of guests and labourers. 
                The Taj Mahal frequently appears on lists of suggested tourist locations, and it is also 
                included in various lists of modern world seven wonders, including the recently released 
                New Seven Wonders of the World, based on a poll with 100 million votes.
