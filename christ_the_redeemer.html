                Christ the Redeemer is an Art Deco statue of Jesus Christ in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 
                erected by Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa in collaboration with French engineer 
                Albert Caquot. Gheorghe Leonida, a Romanian sculptor, created the face. The statue stands 
                30 metres (98 feet) tall, minus its 8-metre (26-foot) pedestal, and was built between 1922 
                and 1931. The arms are 28 metres (92 feet) long. It's built of soapstone and reinforced 
                concrete. <br>
                The statue, which stands at the top of the 700-meter (2,300-foot) Corcovado mountain in the 
                Tijuca National Park overlooking Rio de Janeiro, weighs 635 metric tonnes 
                (625 long, 700 short tonnes). The monument, which has become a cultural icon of both Rio de Janeiro 
                and Brazil, and was named one of the New Seven Wonders of the World, is a symbol of Christianity 
                all over the world.

                In the mid-1850s, Vincentian priest Pedro Maria Boss proposed erecting a Christian monument on Mount Corcovado to 
                honour Princess Isabel, regent of Brazil and daughter of Emperor Pedro II, but the plan was rejected. The country became 
                a republic in 1889, and the intended statue was rejected due to the separation of church and state. <br>
                In 1920, the Catholic Circle of Rio submitted a second proposal for a prominent statue on the summit. The group held an 
                event dubbed Semana do Monumento ("Monument Week") to raise funds and gather signatures in support of the statue's 
                construction. The organisation was founded in response to what they saw as "Godlessness" in society. The majority of 
                the donations came from Catholics in Brazil. A picture of the Christian cross, a statue of Jesus holding a globe, and 
                a pedestal symbolising the world were among the designs considered for the "Statue of the Christ." The statue of Christ 
                the Redeemer with wide arms was chosen as a symbol of peace.

                Restoration of the Statue

                On February 10, 2008, lightning struck the statue during a heavy thunderstorm, causing damage to the fingers, head, 
                and eyebrows. The state government of Rio de Janeiro launched a restoration project to replace some of the statue's 
                outer soapstone layers and fix the lightning rods. On January 17, 2014, lightning struck it again, dislodging a finger 
                on the right hand. <br><br>
                The Archdiocese of Rio de Janeiro, the media firm Grupo Globo, the oil corporation Shell do Brasil, the environmental 
                regulator IBAMA, the National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage, and the city government of Rio de Janeiro 
                signed an agreement to repair the monument in 1990. <br>
                In 2003 and early 2010, more work on the statue and its surroundings was done. To make access to the platform surrounding 
                the statue easier, a series of escalators, walkways, and elevators were erected in 2003. The statue was the centrepiece of 
                the four-month renovation in 2010. By removing a crust of fungi and other germs and mending small cracks, the statue's 
                interior structure was refurbished, and its soapstone mosaic coating was restored. The lightning rods in the head and 
                arms of the statue were also fixed, and new lighting fixtures were put at the statue's foot.
