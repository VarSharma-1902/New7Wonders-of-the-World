                The Colosseum is an oval amphitheatre located immediately east of the Roman Forum in the 
                heart of Rome, Italy. Despite its age, it is the largest ancient amphitheatre ever 
                erected and remains the world's largest standing amphitheatre today. Construction began 
                in 72 under Emperor Vespasian (r. 69–79 AD) and was completed in 80 AD under 
                Titus (r. 79–81 AD), his successor and heir. During the reign of Domitian (r. 81–96), 
                more changes were enacted. The Flavian dynasty was the patrons of the work, and the 
                amphitheatre was renamed the Flavian Amphitheatre by later classicists and archaeologists 
                because of its affiliation with their surname (Flavius). <br>
                Travertine limestone, tuff (volcanic rock), and brick-faced concrete were used to 
                construct the Colosseum. The Colosseum was used for gladiatorial contests and public 
                spectacles such as animal hunts, executions, re-enactments of famous battles, and dramas 
                based on Roman mythology, as well as briefly mock sea battles. It could hold an estimated 
                50,000 to 80,000 spectators at various points in its history, with an average audience of 
                around 65,000. In the early mediaeval century, the structure was no longer used for 
                entertainment. It was afterwards used for homes, workshops, religious order quarters, 
                a castle, a quarry, and a Christian shrine, among other things.

                As proven by Church history and tradition, the Colosseum is widely considered by Christians as 
                the location of the martyrdom of vast thousands of believers during the persecution of Christians 
                in the Roman Empire. Other researchers, on the other hand, feel that the majority of martyrdoms 
                took place elsewhere in Rome, rather than at the Colosseum, citing the paucity of still-intact 
                physical evidence and historical records. According to these experts, "some Christians were 
                executed as common criminals in the Colosseum—their offence being refusal to venerate the Roman 
                gods," but the majority of early Christian martyrs were executed at the Circus Maximus for their 
                beliefs. <br>
                Ignatius of Antioch was fed to the lions at Rome in 107 A.D., according to Irenaeus 
                (died around 202), and while Irenaeus says nothing about this happening at the Colosseum, 
                tradition attributes it to that location.
