                Machu Picchu is a 15th-century Inca citadel built on a 2,430-meter (7,970 ft) mountain crest in southern Peru's 
                Eastern Cordillera. It is 80 kilometres (50 miles) northwest of Cuzco, in the Machupicchu District of Urubamba Province, 
                above the Sacred Valley. The Urubamba River runs through it, slicing through the Cordillera and forming a tropical 
                mountain canyon. <br>
                Machu Picchu was constructed in the Inca tradition, with polished dry-stone walls. The Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, 
                and the Room of the Three Windows are the three main constructions. The majority of the outlying structures have been 
                restored to give visitors a clearer understanding of how they once looked. By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been rebuilt, 
                and the work is still ongoing. <br>
                Machu Picchu was declared a Peruvian Historic Sanctuary in 1981 and a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983. 
                In 2007, Machu Picchu was voted one of the New Seven Wonders of the World in a worldwide internet poll.
