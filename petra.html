                Petra, also known as Raqmu or Raqm by its locals, is a historic and archaeological city 
                in southern Jordan. It is located next to the Jabal Al-Madbah mountain, in a basin 
                surrounded by mountains that constitute the eastern flank of the Arabah valley, which 
                runs from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba. Petra has been inhabited since at least 
                7000 BC, and the Nabataeans may have resided in what would become their kingdom's capital 
                city as early as the 4th century BC. The Nabataeans were nomadic Arabs who established 
                Petra as a key regional economic hub because of its closeness to the incense trade routes.
                <br><br>
                Although the Nabataean kingdom became a client state of the Roman Empire in the first 
                century BC, it was only in 106 AD that it lost its independence. Petra fell to the Romans, 
                who annexed Nabataea and renamed it as Arabia Petraea. Petra's importance declined as sea trade routes 
                emerged, and after an earthquake in 363 destroyed many structures. In the Byzantine era several 
                Christian churches were built, but the city continued to decline, and by the early Islamic era it was 
                abandoned except for a handful of nomads. It remained unknown until it was rediscovered in 1812 by 
                Johann Ludwig Burckhardt.

            </div>
            <div id="content">
                All of the major freestanding and rock-cut structures, as well as extensive archaeological 
                remains within the arid landscape of red sandstone cliffs and gorges, are contained within 
                the property's boundaries, which overlap with the Petra National Park's boundaries. Wind and 
                rain continue to erode the monuments, which has been compounded in the past by windblown sand 
                caused by grazing animals depleting ground cover. The relocation of the Bdul (Bedouin) tribe 
                and their livestock from their former seasonal homes in the Petra basin to a new hamlet at 
                Umm Sayhun more than two decades ago was intended to halt this process. <br>
                If the Nabataean diversion system is not constantly checked, repaired, and maintained, 
                they are likewise subject to flash floods through Wadi Musa through the winding valley (Siq). <br>
                The site is also subject to local community and tourism infrastructure demands. Within 
                the property to the north, a new wastewater treatment facility has been installed, with 
                reclaimed water being used for an adjacent drip irrigation farming project. Inside the 
                boundary, additional infrastructure development is proposed, including an electricity 
                supply and substation, a community/visitor centre, an outdoor theatre for community 
                events, picnic areas, a camping ground, and a new restaurant near the Qasr al Bint 
                temple, all of which have the potential to compromise the property's integrity.
